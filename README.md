# Recipe Time Prediction
This was my submission for Machine Learning (COMP30027) - Project 2. The task was to create machine learning models in Python train on recipes to predict the time taken to
cook it. The models created were : Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbours model, logistic regression model, Naive Bayes model and a SVM. The best performing model was the logistic regression model with a test accuracy of 79% on a dataset of 10,000 recipes.

More information about the task is in the [specification](https://github.com/tharund11/comp30027/blob/main/COMP30027_2021_Project2_new.pdf) and an analysis of my method and results is in the [report](https://github.com/tharund11/comp30027/blob/main/Report.pdf).
